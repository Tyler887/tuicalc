# tuicalc
*a four-function calculator with a terminal UI*

![screenshot](promo.png)

## Usage
1. Install [termpixels][termpixels] using `pip install termpixels`
2. Run `python calc.py` from a terminal (preferrably a good one, like `xterm` or `mlterm`)
3. Click on the buttons with your mouse\*

\*You can type things on the keyboard but that's really not the point

## Caveats
* For best results you should use a terminal that supports mouse input and at least 256 colors. Most terminals do, and if you have trouble, try running `TERM="xterm-256color" python calc.py` instead.
